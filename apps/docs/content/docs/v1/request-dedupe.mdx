title: Request Deduplication
description: Optimize your API calls by preventing duplicate requests
---

Request deduplication helps prevent redundant API calls by managing concurrent requests to the same endpoint. Consider a scenario where a user rapidly clicks a "Refresh Profile" button multiple times - without deduplication, this would trigger multiple unnecessary API calls for the same data. With deduplication, these redundant calls are handled intelligently based on your chosen strategy.

Key benefits:

- Prevents unnecessary server load
- Reduces network bandwidth usage
- Eliminates race conditions
- Improves application performance

## How it works

Request deduplication works by:

1. Generating a unique key for each request based on URL and parameters (or using your custom `dedupeKey`)
2. Tracking in-flight requests using this key
3. Handling duplicate requests according to your chosen strategy

<Callout type="info">
	Requests are only deduplicated when made from the same `callApi` instance. Requests made from different
	instances will be handled independently.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash title="api.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

const callApiOne = createFetchClient();

const callApiTwo = createFetchClient();
const callApiThree = createFetchClient();

// @log: Shared deduplication - these requests are from the same callApi instance, so they will be deduped according to the strategy

const resultOne = callApiOne("/users");
const resultTwo = callApiOne("/users"); // Will dedupe with callApiOne

// @log: Independent deduplication - these requests are from different callApi instances, therefore no deduplication occurs between them

const resultThree = callApiTwo("/users"); // Independent deduplication
const resultFour = callApiThree("/users"); // Independent deduplication
```

## Usage

CallApi provides three deduplication strategies:

### 1. Cancel Strategy (Default)

- Cancels any existing request when a new identical request is made
- Best for scenarios where you only need the latest data

```ts title="api.ts"
const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
	dedupeStrategy: "cancel",
});
```

### 2. Defer Strategy

The `defer` strategy shares the same response promise between duplicate requests. If a request is made while an identical one is still in-flight, it will receive the same response:

```ts title="api.ts"
const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
	dedupeStrategy: "defer",
});
```

### 3. None Strategy

The `none` strategy disables deduplication, allowing each request to execute independently:

```ts title="api.ts"
const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
	dedupeStrategy: "none",
});
```

## Custom deduplication key

If you want to override the default dedupeKey generated internally by callApi, you can specify a custom dedupeKey like so:

```ts title="api.ts"
const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
	dedupeKey: "custom-key",
});
```

## Recommendations

- Use `cancel` when you only need the most recent request to get through
- Use `defer` when multiple components need the same data simultaneously
- Use `none` when requests must be independent, like in polling scenarios etc
