title: Request Deduplication
description: Optimize your API calls by preventing duplicate requests
---

Request deduplication helps prevent redundant API calls by managing concurrent requests to the same endpoint. This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple parts of your application might trigger the same API call simultaneously.

This feature helps eliminate race conditions as well as minimize resource waste.

## Usage

CallApi provides three deduplication strategies through the `dedupeStrategy` option:

1. **cancel** (default)

   - Cancels any existing request when a new identical request is made
   - Best for scenarios where you only need the latest data

   ```ts title="api.ts"
   const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
   	dedupeStrategy: "cancel",
   });
   ```

2. **defer**

   - Reuses the promise from an in-flight request
   - Multiple calls get the same response
   - A possible use case could be scenarios when multiple parts of your application need the same data

   ```ts title="api.ts"
   const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
   	dedupeStrategy: "defer",
   });
   ```

3. **none**

   - Disables deduplication entirely
   - Each request runs independently

   ```ts title="api.ts"
   const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
   	dedupeStrategy: "none",
   });
   ```

## Custom deduplication key

If you want to override the default dedupeKey generated internally by callApi, you can specify a custom dedupeKey like so:

```ts title="api.ts"
const { data } = await callMainApi("/users/123", {
	dedupeKey: "custom-key",
});
```

## How it works

Request deduplication works by:

1. Generating a unique key for each request based on URL and parameters. You can also manually specify the key using the `dedupeKey` option
2. Tracking in-flight requests using this key
3. Applying the chosen strategy when duplicate requests are detected

**NOTE**: Request deduplication only works across all instances created from the same `createFetchClient`.
However, separate client instances maintain their own independent deduplication states.

```ts twoslash title="api.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

const callApiOne = createFetchClient();
const callApiTwo = createFetchClient();
const callApiThree = createFetchClient();

// @log: Shared deduplication - these requests share the same client, so they will be deduped according to the strategy
const resultOne = callApiOne("/users");
const resultTwo = callApiOne("/users"); // Will dedupe with callApiOne

// @log: Independent deduplication - these request are from separate clients, no deduplication occurs between them
const resultThree = callApiTwo("/users"); // Independent deduplication
const resultFour = callApiThree("/users"); // Independent deduplication
```

Any request with the same dedupeKey will be deduplicated according to the chosen strategy.

## Recommendations

- Use `cancel` when you only need the most recent request to get through
- Use `defer` when multiple components need the same data simultaneously
- Use `none` when requests must be independent, like in polling scenarios etc
