## Philosophy

**Lightweight:** Despite its rich feature set, CallApi maintains a tiny footprint (< 3kb). Built with pure ESM and zero dependencies, it's perfect for bundle-size conscious projects. Tree-shaking ensures you only ship what you use. While CJS is supported via a legacy subpath, ESM is recommended for new projects.

**Intuitive:** CallApi mirrors the Fetch API's design patterns, making it a natural drop-in replacement. It extends Fetch's capabilities through additional options that are designed to be pretty intuitive, with sensible defaults that just work.

**Type-safe:** Built from the ground up with TypeScript, CallApi provides proper type hints and intellisense. Response and error types are customizable via generics (with automatic type inference from OpenAPI specs coming in the next version). Even for non-TypeScript users, the DX remains consistent.

**Extensible:** A plugin system and lifecycle hooks let you customize or add functionality without touching the core library. This lets you to add new features or customize existing ones to your specific needs without having to rewrite the entire library.

## vs Axios

Axios is a popular fetching library, and rightly so since it's been fundamental to development of web applications till date.

But major issues with axios in this day and age are involve the facts that:

- It's not based on the modern Fetch API, which is a key part of web development today.
- It's overall API for some use cases is a bit verbose.
- It's lacks type safety, which is a real DX problem.
- It's not lightweight, meaning it might not be suitable for smaller projects under a bundle size constraint.

## vs Ofetch

CallApi is highly inspired by Ofetch. For example, the lifecycle interceptors/hooks idea. As well as the retries and object literal support for the request body.

If you don't need the extra features and convenience options CallApi offers, and don't mind the slightly larger bundle size, Ofetch is equally a good choice since it's also based on the Fetch API.

## vs Zl-Fetch

Some features in CallApi is also inspired by Zl-Fetch. For example, the content-type detection and auth header helper idea.

I also recommend Zl-Fetch if you don't need the extra features and convenience options CallApi offers beyond it.
